# Tic Tac Toe in C++

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, developed in C++ as part of Codecademy exercises.

Features
	•	Two-player gameplay with alternating turns.
	•	Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals.
	•	Input validation to prevent moves on occupied positions.
	•	Modular and concise C++ code using dynamic memory allocation.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites

To compile and run the game, you need a C++ compiler such as:
	•	GCC
	•	Clang
	•	Visual Studio

Voici comment vous pouvez rédiger la section “Installation & Execution” dans un fichier README.md en utilisant le format Markdown :

## Installation & Execution

```
git clone https://github.com/Sheraaa/C---TicTacToe.git
cd tictactoe
g++ -o tictactoe ttt.cpp ttt_functions.cpp
./tictactoe
```
## How to Play

Players take turns to choose a position on the board. Input the row and column numbers as prompted. The first player ('X') to align three symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. If the board is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

Learning Objectives

This project reinforces key C++ concepts, including:
	•	Functions and pointers.
	•	Dynamic memory management.
	•	Logical flow control for game development.

Contributions

Contributions, suggestions, and forks are welcome! Feel free to modify the code and enhance the gameplay.
